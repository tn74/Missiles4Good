This was the final project for our ECE 350L Digital Systems class. My team and I built a computer controlled nerf dart launcher on an FPGA. August wrote a pwm controller to set motor speed and servo positions based on a signal from the FPGA. Will built a projectile motion simulator and visualization. I was responsible for developing for handling keyboard input, developing a controller, and displaying information to the monitor.
